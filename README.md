☐ Getting Started: https://funny-bublanina-bb5a61.netlify.app/

To start this game the user will click on the "Play" button.

After clicking the play, the questions will display with 3 options. The user will choose the best answer and once that answer is clicked, another question will be displayed.

During gameplay the user will be able to keep track of the score and the end the user will  have the option to hit "Play again".

Once the play button is hit, the user will be redirected to the start page.


☐ Next Steps: I would like to add a progress tracker for users to be displayed while they answer questions and a completion animation
