☐ Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, 

☐ I decided to do a Trivia on the film "Point Break" because I felt this would be a good starting to get hands on with HTML, CSS, Javascript. 

☐ Getting Started: https://frabjous-conkies-8504f7.netlify.app/index.html

DIRECTIONS:
To start this game the user will click on the "Start" button.

After clicking start, the questions will display with 3 options. The user will choose the best answer and once that answer is clicked, another question will be displayed.

At the end the user will  have the option to hit "Try again".

Once the Try again button is hit, the user will be redirected to the start page.

☐ Next Steps: I would like to incorporate a score tracker for users to be displayed while they are playing the trivia.
